# Memory

OryxOS gives agents memory across three layers. Each layer has a different scope, lifetime, and storage backend. `MemoryService` is the unified facade that `ReActLoop` and `PromptBuilder` talk to — they do not access layers directly.

## Three layers

| Layer | Storage | Scope | In core phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session memory | SQLite `sessions.messages_json` | Current conversation only | Yes |
| Long-term memory | `.oryxos/agents/<name>/MEMORY.md` (per-agent) | Persists across sessions, per agent | Yes |
| Episodic memory | Vector database (planned) | Semantic search across past sessions | No |

**Session memory** is the conversation history — the list of messages accumulated in the current session. It is serialized as JSON and stored in SQLite. `PromptBuilder` injects the last `max_history_turns` turns into every prompt. It accumulates automatically; agents do not write to it explicitly.

**Long-term memory** is an append-only, timestamped Markdown file agents write to using the `save_memory` tool. It persists across sessions and is injected into every prompt. Agents use it to remember user preferences, project facts, and anything worth keeping past the end of a conversation.

**Episodic memory** is planned for the extension phase. It will index past conversations in a vector database and retrieve semantically relevant episodes at prompt-build time.

## Long-term memory is per-agent

Long-term memory follows the "one directory = one Agent" principle: each agent has its own memory file at `.oryxos/agents/<name>/MEMORY.md`, alongside that agent's `AGENT.md` and `skills/`. When there is no agent context (a direct, non-agent-triggered call, or a unit test), it falls back to the global `.oryxos/memory/MEMORY.md`. The agent name is validated; any unsafe segment falls back to the global file to prevent path traversal.

The current agent is resolved from the execution context — the `save_memory` / `recall_memory` tool path sets it via `ToolExecutionContext`, and the read path (`buildContext` / per-agent read) sets it temporarily around the load.

### Timestamps and two sections

Every entry is written as a **timestamped** line, `- [yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss] <content>`. A `MEMORY.md` file is organized into two sections:

- `## 核心记忆` (**core**) — always injected in full, never truncated
- `## 归档记忆` (**archival**) — entries the agent deliberately saves via `save_memory`; truncated when it grows too large

`save_memory` targets one of these sections (`core` or `archival`). Recall and truncation operate on the **archival** section only; the core section is physically isolated and always kept intact.

### No automatic trigger footprint

OryxOS does **not** auto-append a “user message ⇒ reply” line to archival memory after every trigger. Failed replies that echo the question would otherwise dominate semantic recall and lock the model into repeating the failure. Execution trails already live in `tool_invocations` / `agent_executions`; lasting facts should be written explicitly with `save_memory`.

## Long-term memory operations

`LongTermMemoryStore` (default backend: `MarkdownMemoryStore`) exposes these operations:

| Method | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `append(content, scope)` | Appends a timestamped entry to the core or archival section |
| `load()` | Returns both sections; archival is truncated if oversized, core is returned in full |
| `recallByKeyword(keyword)` | Returns archival lines containing the keyword |
| truncation | If the archival section exceeds 4 000 chars, trims from the top, keeping the most recent content |

The 4 000-character limit prevents the archival section from consuming a disproportionate share of the context window. When truncation occurs, the oldest archival entries are dropped first — recency is prioritized. The core section is never touched.

The interface is designed with an upgrade path to vector search in mind. `recallByKeyword` can be replaced with a semantic search implementation without changing `MemoryService` or any caller.

## Pluggable backends

The long-term memory backend is pluggable via the `memory.backend` config key — swapping it only changes the injected `LongTermMemoryStore`; the `MemoryService` facade signature and every caller stay the same.

| `memory.backend` | Store | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `markdown` (default) | `MarkdownMemoryStore` | Zero-dependency, human-readable, git-trackable Markdown file |
| `sqlite` | `SqliteMemoryStore` | Entries stored row-by-row in the `memory_entries` table; a structured upgrade for larger memory volumes, still zero external dependencies (reuses the existing SQLite) |
| `mem0` | `Mem0MemoryStore` | Delegates to an external mem0 memory service |

## save_memory and recall_memory tools

Agents interact with long-term memory through two built-in tools, not by writing to `MEMORY.md` directly.

**`save_memory`** — appends a piece of text to the current agent's `MEMORY.md`, into the `core` or `archival` section. The agent decides what to save, where, and when. There is no automatic summarization in core phase.

```text
Tool: save_memory
Input: { "content": "User prefers concise responses, no bullet lists.", "scope": "archival" }
Effect: appends a timestamped entry to the agent's MEMORY.md archival section
```

**`recall_memory`** — searches the archival section by keyword and returns matching lines. Useful when the agent needs to check whether it already knows something before saving a duplicate.

```text
Tool: recall_memory
Input:  { "keyword": "prefers" }
Output: "- [2026-07-22 09:30:00] User prefers concise responses, no bullet lists."
```

Both tools go through `ToolExecutor` and are recorded in `tool_invocations` like any other tool call.

## Reading memory over REST

The admin console reads a specific agent's long-term memory through:

```text
GET /api/v1/agents/{name}/memory
```

The response (wrapped in the unified `{ code, message, data, timestamp }` envelope) carries the agent's `MEMORY.md`, which the console renders as **two tables**: 核心记忆 (core) and 归档记忆 (archival).

## How memory is injected into prompts

`PromptBuilder` calls `MemoryService.buildContext(session)` on every loop iteration and inserts the result as the second block of the system prompt, after the Agent identity and Bootstrap files:

```text
[1] system prompt  (AGENT.md body + bootstrap)
[2] MEMORY.md  ← injected here: core in full + archival truncated at 4 000 chars
[3] conversation history (last N turns)
[4] available tools (JSON Schema)
```

The memory block is always present, even if `MEMORY.md` is empty.

## MEMORY.md vs USER.md

These two files look similar but serve opposite purposes:

| | `MEMORY.md` | `USER.md` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who writes it | The agent (via `save_memory`) | The user (manually) |
| OryxOS behavior | Read + write | Read only |
| Contents | Agent's accumulated observations, learned facts, and run history | User's initial preferences and context |
| Resets | Never (append-only; archival truncation only when too large) | Never (managed by user) |
| Location | `.oryxos/agents/<name>/MEMORY.md` (per-agent) | `.oryxos/USER.md` |

`USER.md` is part of the Bootstrap group injected at position [1] in the prompt. `MEMORY.md` is injected at position [2]. Both are visible to the agent; only `MEMORY.md` can be modified by the agent.

## What is planned

- **Episodic memory** — index full session transcripts in a vector database; retrieve the top-k relevant episodes at prompt-build time
- **Vector search for recall** — replace `recallByKeyword` with embedding-based semantic search against `MEMORY.md` content
- **Memory summarization** — automatically compress old entries before truncation to preserve more signal in fewer characters
